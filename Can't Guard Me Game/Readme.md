# CAN'T GUARD ME GAME
A simple time-killer made completely using Python.
**Libraries used**: Pygame

In your terminal type the command:

Run the ``` main.py ``` and you are good to go.
**Note:** This game is inspired from a youtube video and is still under development.I am trying to use this as a base and create a different modified version of the game.
